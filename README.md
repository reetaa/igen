### She Hacks 2017
14 Oct 2017

**Team: Weijia and Reeta**

This app will let you find a role model to look up and get everyday motivational posters
It's a node project with bot for inspirational posters - promoting female achievers.

*Why we joined `She Hacks`?*

To get mentorship, to learn, to network, to be inspired, to inspire with the app we create.

We are unable to find female role models around us.
In IT industry, amazing women exist but not visible.

*What are we making?*
- Open Source app
- Proactive inspirational posters
- Integrated with the slack/skype/service of your choice
- Get motivated
  - example case: `Girl Geek` team adds a channel to their slack dedicated for inspirations

*How did it come along?*
- Microsoft bot framework - `Botbuilder`
- `Node.js`
- `Canvas`
- `Unplashed API` - image
- `Forismatic API` - quotes
- `Axios` - ajax for node
- `Restify`
Motivations shouldnâ€™t cost money so this app is open sourced.

*MVP?*
- bot that provides motivational posters
- 2 APIs integrated in node.js
The node server.fetches: `image response`. `text response`.
`node.js` draws `canvas` with layer of image and the quote.
Started as front end project and completed doing node bot. Biggest learning experience.

*What next?*
- expect app to be used practically once it can be `integrate with other apps`
- met amazing people and mentors so looking into `VR` and `NLP`
- also will look at `smart bots`
- take part more to `learn and improve`
