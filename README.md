## She Hacks 2017
14 Oct 2017

**Team: Weijia and Reeta**

This app will let you find a role model to look up and get everyday motivational posters.
It's a node project with bot for inspirational posters - promoting female achievers.

## How to run and test it out?
- Download the repo and enter the `server` directory and run `npm install`
- Download the [Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases/tag/v3.5.31)
- Install the required dependencies for utilising [Canvas API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas) in Node.js. For examples, if you are using a Mac, run `brew install pkg-config cairo libpng jpeg giflib` at the `server` directory and then run `npm install canvas` in your terminal. 
- Now run `node app.js` and go back to emulator and click connect, when it succeeds, type anything to view the bot response.   


## Why we joined `She Hacks`?

To get mentorship, to learn, to network, to be inspired, to inspire with the app we create.

We are unable to find female role models around us.
In IT industry, amazing women exist but not visible.

## What are we making?
- Open Source app
- Proactive inspirational posters
- Integrated with the slack/skype/service of your choice
- Get motivated
  - example case: `Girl Geek` team adds a channel to their slack dedicated for inspirations

## How did it come along?
- Microsoft bot framework - `Botbuilder`
- `Node.js`
- `Canvas`
- `Unplashed API` - image
- `Forismatic API` - quotes
- `Axios` - ajax for node
- `Restify`
Motivations shouldnâ€™t cost money so this app is open sourced.

## MVP?
- bot that provides motivational posters
- 2 APIs integrated in node.js
The node server.fetches: `image response`. `text response`.
`node.js` draws `canvas` with layer of image and the quote.
Started as front end project and completed doing node bot. Biggest learning experience.

## What next?
- expect app to be used practically once it can be `integrate with other apps`
- met amazing people and mentors so looking into learning `VR` and `NLP`
- also will look at `smart bots`
- take part more to `learn and improve`
